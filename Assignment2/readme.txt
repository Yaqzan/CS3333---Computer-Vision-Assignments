The program takes 2 images, calculates the optical flow, and uses that to reconstruct
a new image. THen finds the mean and standard deviation of the 2 images.

Make sure openCV is installed in the workspace environment. Compile and run the program with g++.
    At the command line, include the path names for the two images to be compared
    Example: g++ main.cpp -o run
			run 1.png 2.png
